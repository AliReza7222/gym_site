<h1>gym_site</h1>
<p>
  During a period of time, I was thinking that I could implement a site so that I could see the clubs in our city or other cities or I 
  could register in the clubs, so I started to implement it.
</p>
<p>
  This site has two types of users:
</p>
<h3>
  1_Master:
</h3>
<p>
This user can create a gym and accept students for enrollment. and other options.
</p>

<h3>
  2_Student
</h3>
<p>
This user can see gyms available and register in these gyms . and other options.
</p>
<h3>About site :</h3>
<p>
  This project has two other programs (conversation and payment) for two users.
</p>

<p>
Every user must register to use the site's options, and after registration, she must complete her/his profile before using the options.</p>

<p>In the payment app, the student user can charge her/his account with a payment gateway simulator, and the teacher user can also transfer the money obtained from student registration.</p>

<p>In Converstion app, the teacher user can create a notification for the students of the desired club, that's the current use of this app.</p>
<h3>for run project: </h3> 
<pre>1_First, you must install the requirements.txt file with the following command:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
2_Another important point is that you have to configure the project yourself, I did not include them 
  for security reasons -> this file settings.py
</pre>
